## 🎯 Course Title

**Programming Logic & Algorithms with Python**

---

## 🎓 Course Description

This course builds the **foundational thinking systems** required to become a professional software engineer and computer scientist.
Students will master:

* Computational thinking
* Logic & problem decomposition
* Flowcharts & pseudocode
* Python programming fundamentals
* Algorithmic thinking (loops, conditions, functions)
* Debugging & testing
* Data structures & file handling
* Time complexity fundamentals

This is not “learn Python basics quickly.”
It is a **deep cognitive training program** designed to rewire students to think like expert programmers.

By the end, a student with zero programming experience will be able to:

* Design and implement Python programs
* Transform real-world problems into algorithms
* Debug, test, and optimize beginner-intermediate code
* Work independently on structured programming tasks

---

## 🧠 Skills You Will Gain

* ✅ Computational & algorithmic thinking
* ✅ Problem decomposition & abstraction
* ✅ Python programming fundamentals
* ✅ Debugging & testing techniques
* ✅ Time complexity intuition
* ✅ Beginner-level software engineering habits

---

## 🧩 Key Topics Covered

* Breaking problems into steps
* Flowcharts & pseudocode
* Variables, types, expressions
* Control flow: `if`, `for`, `while`
* Functions, parameters, return values
* Lists, tuples, dictionaries
* Basic file I/O
* Algorithm design patterns
* Error handling fundamentals
* Intro to Big-O efficiency thinking

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3.x**
