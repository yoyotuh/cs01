## ✅ Week 9 — Introduction to Algorithms & Problem Solving

**Theme:** Algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, and basic strategies

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 9, students will be able to:

* ✅ Understand what an algorithm is and why it is important
* ✅ Represent algorithms using **pseudocode** and **flowcharts**
* ✅ Apply step-by-step problem-solving strategies
* ✅ Solve simple computational problems: counting, summing, searching
* ✅ Debug logical errors in small programs

---

### 📘 Deep Concepts Explained

#### 🔹 What is an Algorithm?

**Definition:** A finite sequence of steps to solve a problem.

**Real-world analogy:**

* Cooking a recipe → steps, order, input ingredients → final dish
* Algorithm = Recipe, Program = Cooked Dish

**Properties of algorithms:**

1. Finiteness → terminates after finite steps
2. Definiteness → each step is clear and unambiguous
3. Input → zero or more values
4. Output → produces at least one result
5. Effectiveness → steps are basic and executable

---

#### 🔹 Pseudocode

* Plain-English, step-by-step representation of an algorithm
* Not language-specific, focuses on **logic**

**Example:** Sum first N numbers

```
Algorithm SumFirstN
Input: integer N
Output: sum of numbers 1 to N

1. Initialize sum = 0
2. For i = 1 to N
     sum = sum + i
3. Output sum
```

---

#### 🔹 Flowcharts

* Visual representation of an algorithm using shapes:

| Shape         | Meaning             |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Oval          | Start/End           |
| Rectangle     | Process/Instruction |
| Diamond       | Decision/Condition  |
| Parallelogram | Input/Output        |

**Example:** Flowchart for sum 1 to N

* Start → Input N → sum=0 → i=1 → Is i≤N? → Yes → sum=sum+i → i=i+1 → repeat → No → Output sum → End

---

#### 🔹 Problem-Solving Steps

1. Understand the problem → inputs, outputs, constraints
2. Break problem into smaller tasks
3. Identify patterns and repetition
4. Choose suitable data structures
5. Write pseudocode or flowchart
6. Implement in Python
7. Test and debug

---

### ✅ Python Code Examples

#### Example 1 — Sum of First N Numbers

```python
N = int(input("Enter N: "))
total = 0

for i in range(1, N+1):
    total += i

print("Sum =", total)
```

#### Example 2 — Count Even Numbers in List

```python
numbers = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
count = 0

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        count += 1

print("Even numbers =", count)
```

#### Example 3 — Find Maximum in List

```python
numbers = [5, 10, 3, 8, 2]
max_num = numbers[0]

for num in numbers:
    if num > max_num:
        max_num = num

print("Maximum:", max_num)
```

### 🏫 In-Class Exercises (3)

1. Input a number N, print all odd numbers from 1 to N.
2. Input a list of numbers, count how many are greater than 10.
3. Input a list of numbers, find the minimum value using a loop.

---

### ✅ Solutions

**Exercise 1**

```python
N = int(input("Enter N: "))
for i in range(1, N+1):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i)
```

**Exercise 2**

```python
numbers = [5,12,7,15,3,20]
count = 0

for num in numbers:
    if num > 10:
        count += 1

print("Numbers greater than 10:", count)
```

**Exercise 3**

```python
numbers = [5,12,7,15,3,20]
min_num = numbers[0]

for num in numbers:
    if num < min_num:
        min_num = num

print("Minimum:", min_num)
```

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Best Practices

| Mistake                       | Solution                                |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Not understanding the problem | Write inputs, outputs clearly           |
| Incorrect loop boundaries     | Always check `range()` limits           |
| Not updating accumulator      | Initialize and increment correctly      |
| Confusing flowchart shapes    | Use proper standard shapes consistently |
