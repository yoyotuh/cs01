## ✅ Week 12 — Mini Project: Search & Counting Application

**Theme:** Applying sequences, search, counting, and exception handling

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 12, students will be able to:

* ✅ Design a small project integrating lists, dictionaries, and loops
* ✅ Implement linear search and counting algorithms
* ✅ Handle user input and runtime exceptions
* ✅ Debug and test their program effectively
* ✅ Apply basic optimization to improve performance

---

### 📘 Deep Concepts Explained

#### 🔹 Project Overview

**Project Idea:**
Build a **“Student Grades Analyzer”** that:

1. Stores students’ names and grades
2. Allows searching for a student by name
3. Counts how many students have grades above a threshold
4. Displays statistics (highest, lowest, average)

**Steps to approach project:**

1. Plan input/output
2. Decide data structure (list of dictionaries)
3. Implement functions:

   * Add student
   * Search student
   * Count above threshold
   * Calculate statistics
4. Test with sample data
5. Handle exceptions (invalid input, missing data)

### ✅ Python Code Example — Complete Mini Project

```python
# Student Grades Analyzer

students = []

def add_student(name, grade):
    students.append({"name": name, "grade": grade})

def search_student(name):
    for student in students:
        if student["name"].lower() == name.lower():
            return student
    return None

def count_above(threshold):
    count = 0
    for student in students:
        if student["grade"] > threshold:
            count += 1
    return count

def statistics():
    if not students:
        return None
    grades = [s["grade"] for s in students]
    return {
        "max": max(grades),
        "min": min(grades),
        "average": sum(grades)/len(grades)
    }

# Sample data
add_student("Alice", 90)
add_student("Bob", 75)
add_student("Charlie", 85)

# User interaction
try:
    name = input("Enter student name to search: ")
    result = search_student(name)
    if result:
        print(f"{result['name']} → {result['grade']}")
    else:
        print("Student not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)

print("Students with grade > 80:", count_above(80))
stats = statistics()
print("Statistics:", stats)
```

### 🏫 In-Class Exercises (3)

1. Add 2 more students and test search function.
2. Modify `count_above()` to accept user input threshold.
3. Print the names of students with grades above the threshold.

---

### ✅ Solutions

**Exercise 1**

```python
add_student("David", 92)
add_student("Eva", 88)

print(search_student("David"))  # {'name': 'David', 'grade': 92}
```

**Exercise 2**

```python
threshold = int(input("Enter grade threshold: "))
print("Count above threshold:", count_above(threshold))
```

**Exercise 3**

```python
threshold = int(input("Enter grade threshold: "))
print("Students above threshold:")
for student in students:
    if student["grade"] > threshold:
        print(student["name"])
```

---

### 🏠 Take-Home Assignments (3)

1. Extend project to allow deleting a student by name.
2. Modify project to read student data from a CSV file.
3. Implement a function to sort students by grade descending.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Best Practices

| Mistake                  | Solution                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Not handling empty lists | Always check before processing                |
| Case-sensitive search    | Use `.lower()` for comparison                 |
| Redundant loops          | Optimize with dictionary if frequent searches |
| Invalid user input       | Use `try/except` for safety                   |
