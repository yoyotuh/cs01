* ✅ Analyze time complexity of sorting and combined algorithms

---

### 📘 Deep Concepts Explained

#### 🔹 Combining Functions, Loops, and Data Structures

* Modular functions allow splitting problems into smaller, manageable units
* Loops allow repetition to process lists, strings, or dictionaries
* Example: Counting grades above a threshold using a function

```python
def count_above_threshold(grades, threshold):
    count = 0
    for grade in grades:
        if grade > threshold:
            count += 1
    return count

grades = [70,85,90,60,95]
print(count_above_threshold(grades, 80))  # Output: 3
```

---

#### 🔹 Introduction to Sorting Algorithms

**1. Bubble Sort**

* Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
* O(n²) complexity

```python
def bubble_sort(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if lst[j] > lst[j+1]:
                lst[j], lst[j+1] = lst[j+1], lst[j]
    return lst

numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print(bubble_sort(numbers))
```

**2. Selection Sort**

* Repeatedly selects the smallest element and moves it to the front
* O(n²) complexity

```python
def selection_sort(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if lst[j] < lst[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        lst[i], lst[min_idx] = lst[min_idx], lst[i]
    return lst

numbers = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
print(selection_sort(numbers))
```

#### 🔹 Applying Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Understand the problem** → inputs, outputs
2. **Break into functions** → modular code
3. **Choose proper data structure** → list, dict, set
4. **Implement logic using loops and conditionals**
5. **Test with small examples** → verify correctness
6. **Analyze performance** → check time complexity

### ✅ Python Code Examples

#### Example 1 — Count Occurrences in List Using Functions

```python
def count_occurrences(lst, target):
    count = 0
    for item in lst:
        if item == target:
            count += 1
    return count

numbers = [1,2,3,2,4,2,5]
print(count_occurrences(numbers, 2))  # Output: 3
```

#### Example 2 — Sorting Student Grades

```python
grades = [88, 92, 75, 60, 85]

# Bubble sort
for i in range(len(grades)):
    for j in range(0, len(grades)-i-1):
        if grades[j] > grades[j+1]:
            grades[j], grades[j+1] = grades[j+1], grades[j]

print("Sorted Grades:", grades)
```

#### Example 3 — Combined Problem

```python
students = [{"name":"Alice","grade":90},{"name":"Bob","grade":75},{"name":"Charlie","grade":85}]

def top_students(students, threshold):
    top = []
    for s in students:
        if s["grade"] > threshold:
            top.append(s["name"])
    return top

print(top_students(students, 80))  # ['Alice','Charlie']
```

### ✅ Solutions

**Exercise 1**

```python
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    for j in range(0, len(numbers)-i-1):
        if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:
            numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]
    print("Pass", i+1, ":", numbers)
```

**Exercise 2**

```python
students = [{"name":"Alice","grade":90},{"name":"Bob","grade":75},{"name":"Charlie","grade":85}]
def count_between(students, low, high):
    count = 0
    for s in students:
        if low <= s["grade"] <= high:
            count += 1
    return count

print(count_between(students,70,90))  # 3
```

**Exercise 3**

```python
strings = ["banana","apple","cherry","date"]
n = len(strings)
for i in range(n):
    min_idx = i
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        if strings[j] < strings[min_idx]:
            min_idx = j
    strings[i], strings[min_idx] = strings[min_idx], strings[i]

print(strings)  # ['apple','banana','cherry','date']
```

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Best Practices

| Mistake                        | Solution                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Not swapping correctly in sort | Use `a,b = b,a` syntax                     |
| Incorrect loop ranges          | Verify start/end indices for nested loops  |
| Modifying list while iterating | Use indices or separate list               |
| Redundant code                 | Use functions to modularize repeated logic |
