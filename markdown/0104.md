## ✅ Week 4 — Loops & Iteration

**Theme:** Repetition, automation, and algorithm cycles using `for` and `while`

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 4, students will be able to:

* ✅ Explain why loops are necessary in programming
* ✅ Use `for` and `while` loops to repeat tasks
* ✅ Understand iteration sequences (`range()`)
* ✅ Apply loop counters, accumulators, and conditions
* ✅ Identify and avoid infinite loops
* ✅ Solve problems using loops (counting, summing, searching)

### 📘 Deep Concepts Explained

#### 🔁 What is a Loop?

**Academic definition:**
A loop is a control structure that repeats a block of code until a condition is met.

**Beginner analogy:**
Loops are like alarm clocks that ring every morning until you turn them off — repetition until condition ends it.

---

### 🧠 Why Do We Need Loops?

Without loops:

```python
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
```

With loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")
```

> Loops = **write once, repeat many times**

### 🔄 Two Types of Loops

| Type    | Best for                     | Structure                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `for`   | Known number of repetitions  | loop over sequence or range        |
| `while` | Loop until condition changes | condition evaluates each iteration |

---

### 🧮 `for` loop with `range()`

Range patterns:

| Pattern             | Meaning         |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| `range(n)`          | 0 → n-1         |
| `range(a, b)`       | a → b-1         |
| `range(a, b, step)` | step increments |

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)   # prints 1 to 5
```

---

### 🧷 Accumulator Pattern (Very Important)

```python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    total = total + i
print(total)   # 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
```

This pattern appears constantly in computing: sum, count, search, average, etc.

---

### 🔁 `while` Loop

```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

---

### ⚠️ Infinite Loop Warning

```python
while True:
    print("Never stops")
```

> Always ensure a **stop condition** changes.

---

### ✅ Python Code Examples

#### Example 1 — Count 1 to 10

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

#### Example 2 — Sum first 100 numbers

```python
total = 0
for n in range(1, 101):
    total += n
print(total)
```

#### Example 3 — While loop input validation

```python
age = int(input("Enter age (positive number): "))

while age <= 0:
    print("Age must be positive!")
    age = int(input("Re-enter age: "))

print("Thanks!")
```

### 🏫 In-Class Exercises (3)

#### Exercise 1

Print numbers from 10 down to 1.

#### Exercise 2

Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N (N from input).

#### Exercise 3

Keep asking password until user enters `"python123"`.

---

### ✅ Solutions

#### Solution 1

```python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
```

#### Solution 2

```python
n = int(input("Enter N: "))
total = 0

for i in range(1, n+1):
    total += i

print("Sum =", total)
```

#### Solution 3

```python
password = input("Enter password: ")

while password != "python123":
    print("Wrong, try again.")
    password = input("Enter password: ")

print("Access granted.")
```

### 🏠 Take-Home Assignments (3)

#### 1️⃣ Multiplication table generator

Input: a number
Output: multiplication table 1–10

#### 2️⃣ Sum of even numbers 1–100

Use a loop + condition

#### 3️⃣ Guessing game

Computer asks user to enter number until correct guess (simple fixed number now)

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Problem                                 | Fix                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Forgetting increment in `while`         | Always update loop variable |
| Using `range()` incorrectly             | Remember end is exclusive   |
| Infinite loops                          | Check termination logic     |
| Using wrong accumulator (`=+` not `+=`) | Correct form: `total += x`  |
