### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 10, students will be able to:

* ✅ Understand **linear search** and how to implement it
* ✅ Count occurrences of elements in a list or string
* ✅ Use iteration with conditions to analyze datasets
* ✅ Debug common logical errors in search/count algorithms
* ✅ Evaluate simple time complexity (O(n))

---

### 📘 Deep Concepts Explained

#### 🔹 Linear Search

**Definition:** Sequentially check each element until the target is found.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Input: list `L` and target `x`
2. For each element in `L`, check if it equals `x`
3. If found, return index or True
4. If not found, return -1 or False

**Real-world analogy:** Searching for a book on a shelf by checking each one in order.

---

#### 🔹 Python Implementation: Linear Search

```python
def linear_search(lst, target):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if lst[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

numbers = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7]
print("Index of 6:", linear_search(numbers, 6))  # Output: 3
print("Index of 10:", linear_search(numbers, 10))  # Output: -1
```

---

#### 🔹 Counting Occurrences

**Task:** Count how many times an element appears.

```python
numbers = [1,2,2,3,2,4,5]
count = 0
for num in numbers:
    if num == 2:
        count += 1

print("2 appears", count, "times")
```

**Using dictionary for multiple elements:**

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry"]
freq = {}
for word in words:
    if word in freq:
        freq[word] += 1
    else:
        freq[word] = 1

print(freq)  # {'apple': 2, 'banana': 1, 'cherry': 1}
```

---

#### 🔹 Searching in Strings

```python
text = "hello world"
target = "l"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == target:
        count += 1

print(f"'{target}' appears {count} times")
```

---

### ✅ Python Code Examples

#### Example 1 — Find First Even Number

```python
numbers = [5,7,9,8,12]
for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("First even number:", num)
        break
```

#### Example 2 — Count Vowels

```python
text = "programming is fun"
vowels = "aeiou"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char in vowels:
        count += 1

print("Number of vowels:", count)
```

#### Example 3 — Frequency Dictionary

```python
grades = [90,85,90,78,85,90]
freq = {}

for g in grades:
    freq[g] = freq.get(g,0) + 1

print(freq)  # {90: 3, 85: 2, 78: 1}
```

### 🏫 In-Class Exercises (3)

1. Input a list of 10 numbers, find the index of number 7.
2. Count how many odd numbers are in a list.
3. Count the occurrence of each character in a string.

---

### ✅ Solutions

**Exercise 1**

```python
numbers = [2,3,5,7,9,1,4,7,8,6]

def find_index(lst, target):
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if num == target:
            return i
    return -1

print(find_index(numbers, 7))  # 3
```

**Exercise 2**

```python
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
count = 0
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        count += 1
print("Odd numbers:", count)  # 5
```

**Exercise 3**

```python
text = "hello world"
freq = {}
for char in text:
    freq[char] = freq.get(char,0) + 1
print(freq)
```

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Best Practices

| Mistake                       | Solution                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Forgetting `break` when found | Use `break` to stop search once found |
| Counting incorrectly          | Initialize counter before loop        |
| Overwriting dictionary        | Use `get()` or check existence        |
| Searching wrong type          | Ensure consistent data types          |
