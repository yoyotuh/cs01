## ✅ Week 16 — Final Capstone Project

**Theme:** Integrating all concepts learned into a complete application

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 16, students will be able to:

* ✅ Design a complete Python application using loops, functions, and data structures
* ✅ Apply searching, counting, and sorting algorithms effectively
* ✅ Implement recursive solutions where appropriate
* ✅ Handle user input, exceptions, and program errors
* ✅ Test, debug, and optimize the application
* ✅ Present a mini report with project results

### 📘 Deep Concepts Explained

#### 🔹 Capstone Project Overview

**Project Idea:**
**“Student Performance Manager”**

Features:

1. Add, update, and delete students
2. Search for a student by name (linear or binary search)
3. Count students above/below a grade threshold
4. Display statistics (highest, lowest, average)
5. Sort students by grade (bubble sort / merge sort)
6. Recursive features (e.g., calculating factorial, sum, or nested list sums)
7. Handle invalid input and exceptions

**Design Steps:**

1. **Plan modules:** separate functions for each feature
2. **Choose data structures:** list of dictionaries for student records
3. **Implement algorithms:** search, count, sort, recursion
4. **Test extensively:** small datasets first
5. **Add input validation:** ensure program doesn’t crash
6. **Optimize performance:** avoid redundant loops, use dictionaries where needed

### ✅ Python Code Example — Capstone Skeleton

```python
students = []

def add_student(name, grade):
    students.append({"name": name, "grade": grade})

def update_student(name, grade):
    for s in students:
        if s["name"].lower() == name.lower():
            s["grade"] = grade
            return True
    return False

def delete_student(name):
    global students
    students = [s for s in students if s["name"].lower() != name.lower()]

def search_student(name):
    for s in students:
        if s["name"].lower() == name.lower():
            return s
    return None

def count_above(threshold):
    return sum(1 for s in students if s["grade"] > threshold)

def statistics():
    if not students:
        return None
    grades = [s["grade"] for s in students]
    return {"max": max(grades), "min": min(grades), "average": sum(grades)/len(grades)}

# Example: Recursive function for factorial
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0: return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

# Sorting: Bubble Sort by grade
def sort_students_by_grade():
    n = len(students)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if students[j]["grade"] > students[j+1]["grade"]:
                students[j], students[j+1] = students[j+1], students[j]

# Sample usage
add_student("Alice", 90)
add_student("Bob", 75)
add_student("Charlie", 85)

print("Student Stats:", statistics())
print("Students above 80:", count_above(80))
sort_students_by_grade()
print("Sorted Students:", students)
```

### 🏫 In-Class Exercises (3)

1. Add a menu system for user interaction: Add, Search, Update, Delete, Statistics.
2. Implement recursive sum of all grades.
3. Test sorting students by name alphabetically instead of grade.

---

### ✅ Solutions

**Exercise 1 — Menu System Skeleton**

```python
while True:
    print("\nMenu: 1-Add, 2-Search, 3-Update, 4-Delete, 5-Stats, 6-Exit")
    choice = input("Choose: ")
    if choice == "1":
        name = input("Name: ")
        grade = int(input("Grade: "))
        add_student(name, grade)
    elif choice == "2":
        name = input("Search Name: ")
        print(search_student(name))
    elif choice == "3":
        name = input("Update Name: ")
        grade = int(input("New Grade: "))
        print(update_student(name, grade))
    elif choice == "4":
        name = input("Delete Name: ")
        delete_student(name)
    elif choice == "5":
        print(statistics())
    elif choice == "6":
        break
```

**Exercise 2 — Recursive Sum of Grades**

```python
def recursive_sum_grades(lst):
    if not lst:
        return 0
    return lst[0]["grade"] + recursive_sum_grades(lst[1:])

print("Total Grades:", recursive_sum_grades(students))
```

**Exercise 3 — Sort by Name**

```python
students.sort(key=lambda x: x["name"])
print("Students sorted by name:", students)
```

### 🏠 Take-Home Assignments (3)

1. Extend project: allow saving/loading data from CSV files.
2. Implement a function to display top N students by grade.
3. Optimize search: implement binary search on sorted student names.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Best Practices

| Mistake                         | Solution                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not modularizing                | Split program into functions for each feature            |
| Unsorted list for binary search | Sort first before applying binary search                 |
| Invalid user input              | Always validate and use try/except                       |
| Redundant loops                 | Use dictionaries or generator expressions where possible |
