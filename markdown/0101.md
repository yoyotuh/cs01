## ✅ Week 1 — Thinking Like a Computer Scientist

**Theme:** Computational Thinking, Algorithms, Flowcharts, and Pseudocode

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 1, students will be able to:

* ✅ Break real-world problems into algorithmic steps (decomposition)
* ✅ Translate logical ideas into **flowcharts** and **pseudocode**
* ✅ Understand the cycle: **Think → Plan → Code → Test**
* ✅ Explain how computers interpret instructions
* ✅ Write their first simple algorithm and Python “Hello World” program

---

### 📘 Core Concepts Explained (Deep Theory + Plain English)

#### 🧠 What is Computational Thinking?

**Academic definition:**
A systematic approach to problem-solving used in computer science that involves decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic design.

**Beginner explanation:**
Computational thinking teaches you to solve problems step-by-step like a computer, not randomly like humans often do.

**Real-world analogy:**
Think like a chef using a recipe. Every step must be in the right order, clear, reproducible, and leave no room for guessing.

#### 🔍 Core Thinking Components

| Concept             | Meaning                              | Real-World Example                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Decomposition       | Break big problem into smaller tasks | Cooking: prepare ingredients, heat pan, cook |
| Pattern Recognition | Notice repeated ideas                | Buttons always click, login screens similar  |
| Abstraction         | Focus on important parts only        | Driving: ignore trees, follow road signs     |
| Algorithm Design    | Write exact steps to solve           | Recipe, ATM steps, Google Maps route         |

---

#### 🧾 Algorithm vs Code

| Term      | Meaning                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Algorithm | Human-readable steps to solve a problem              |
| Code      | Machine-readable instructions implementing algorithm |

> 💡 **First learn to think. Code comes after thought.**

#### 🔄 Flowcharts & Pseudocode

**Flowchart** = visual plan
**Pseudocode** = English-like algorithm

Flowchart example (boiling egg):

```
Start → Fill pot → Add eggs → Boil water → Wait 7 minutes → Stop heat → Serve → End
```

Pseudocode version:

```
Start
Fill pot with water
Add eggs
Boil water
Wait 7 minutes
Turn off heat
Serve eggs
End
```

#### 👨‍💻 First Python Program

```python
# My first Python program
print("Hello, world!")
```

### 🏫 In-Class Exercises (3)

#### ✅ Exercise 1: Toothbrushing Algorithm

Write a step-by-step algorithm to brush teeth.

#### ✅ Exercise 2: Flowchart for making tea

Draw a flowchart for:
**boil water → add tea → steep → add sugar → serve**

#### ✅ Exercise 3: First Python Output

Write a program to print your name and reason for learning programming.

```python
print("My name is ___")
print("I want to learn programming because ___")
```

---

### 🧠 Solutions to In-Class Exercises

#### ✅ Solution 1: Toothbrushing

```
Pick toothbrush
Apply toothpaste
Wet toothbrush
Brush teeth for 2 minutes
Rinse mouth
Rinse brush
Store brush
```

#### ✅ Solution 2: Tea Flowchart (pseudocode)

```
Start
Boil water
Add tea leaves
Wait 3-5 minutes
Add sugar
Serve
End
```

#### ✅ Solution 3: Python Output Example

```python
print("My name is Sam")
print("I want to learn programming because I love building apps")
```

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Best Practices

| Mistake                                 | Fix                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Writing code without planning           | Always sketch flowchart/pseudocode first |
| Too many steps or too few steps         | Steps must be clear, complete, logical   |
| Using natural language, not algorithmic | Use simple short commands                |
| Skipping debugging                      | Test small programs frequently           |
