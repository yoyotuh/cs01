## ✅ Week 2 — Variables, Data Types & Memory

**Theme:** Understanding data, variables, memory, input/output

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 2, students will be able to:

* ✅ Explain what data and variables are in computing
* ✅ Understand how memory stores values
* ✅ Use Python variables correctly
* ✅ Work with basic data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* ✅ Use `input()` to receive information from the user
* ✅ Print formatted output to the screen

---

### 📘 Deep Concepts Explained

#### 💾 What is Data?

**Academic definition:**
Data is raw information that a program stores, manipulates, and processes to produce meaningful output.

**Beginner analogy:**
Data is like ingredients in cooking.
Your program is a kitchen that turns ingredients (data) into dishes (results).

---

#### 📦 What is a Variable?

**Academic definition:**
A variable is a named memory location used to store data.

**Beginner analogy:**
A variable is like a labeled container. You store something inside and use its label to find it later.

Example:

| Variable Name | Stored Value |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| age           | 21           |
| name          | "Sarah"      |
| is_student    | True         |

#### 🧠 How Memory Works (Simplified)

| Action      | Memory Meaning                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `x = 5`     | A box labeled `x` is created and stores value `5`     |
| `x = x + 1` | Retrieve `x`, add 1, store new value in same location |

> Computers don't “understand” meaning — only **numbers and addresses**.

#### 🧮 Data Types in Python

| Type             | Example    | Meaning         |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Integer (`int`)  | 5, -3      | Whole numbers   |
| Float (`float`)  | 3.14       | Decimal numbers |
| String (`str`)   | "Hello"    | Text            |
| Boolean (`bool`) | True/False | Logical values  |

---

#### 🖨️ Input & Output

**Output:** display information

```python
print("Hello!")
```

**Input:** ask user for info

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

**Python treats input as string by default**
Convert when needed:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

---

### ✅ Python Code Examples

#### Example 1: Simple variables

```python
name = "Ari"
age = 19
height = 1.70

print(name, age, height)
```

#### Example 2: Input & formatted output

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
city = input("Where do you live? ")

print("Hello", name + "! You live in", city)
```

#### Example 3: Convert string input to int

```python
year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))
age = 2025 - year
print("Your age is", age)
```

### 🏫 In-Class Exercises (3)

#### ✅ Exercise 1

Define variables for:

* your name
* your age
* your favorite hobby

Print them on separate lines.

#### ✅ Exercise 2

Ask user for two numbers and print their sum.

#### ✅ Exercise 3

Write a program to calculate area of a rectangle:
Area = width × height
Ask user for width & height.

---

### 🧠 Solutions

#### Solution 1

```python
name = "Dina"
age = 20
hobby = "Reading"

print(name)
print(age)
print(hobby)
```

#### Solution 2

```python
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

print("Sum is:", a + b)
```

#### Solution 3

```python
width = float(input("Width: "))
height = float(input("Height: "))

area = width * height
print("Area =", area)
```

### 🏠 Take-Home Assignments (3)

#### 1️⃣ User Profile Program

Ask name, age, major, and print:

```
Hello ___, you are ___ years old and study ___
```

#### 2️⃣ Temperature Converter

Input Celsius, output Fahrenheit

Formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32

#### 3️⃣ Rectangle Perimeter

Perimeter = 2 × (width + height)

Ask values → compute → print

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Best Practices

| Mistake                                 | Correct Approach                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Using numbers like `"5"` instead of `5` | Convert input properly: `int()` |
| Forgetting `print()`                    | Always output results           |
| Spaces in variable names                | Use underscores: `user_name`    |
| Meaningless names like `x1, dataA`      | Use descriptive variable names  |
